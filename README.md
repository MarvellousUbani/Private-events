# Private-events
This project consist of building a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

### Getting started
To get started with the app, first clone the repo and cd into the directory:

### Live Version
[Coming Soon](#)

```
$ git clone git@github.com:KerronKing/rails-private-events.git
$ cd rails-private-events
```

Then install the needed gems (while skipping any gems needed only in production):

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
